## Ultimate Chord Reader - WORK IN PROGRESS, DO NOT INSTALL LOCALLY UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING

The `ultimate_chord_reader.py` script provides a local workflow for transcribing songs. Drop audio files into `input_songs/` and run `python ultimate_chord_reader.py` to generate text chord charts in `output_charts/`.

The script will attempt to install any missing Python packages when you run it.
You can still pre-install everything manually with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
